## Databases Used:

### Police Incident Blotter (Zach's Data):

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data

This dataset contains UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting) validated crime incidents since 2005. It's organized by type of crime, location, date, and more. It only contains data from the City of Pittsburgh Police.

----

### Rafael's Data:

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data/resource/d159c6b3-f70a-439b-bd2b-0cb8735d76d4

This dataset contains the total estimated income for all Pittsburgh neighborhoods. This data incorporates factors such as wages, salary, Armed Forces pay, commissions, tips, piece-rate payments, and cash bonuses earned before deductions were made for taxes, bonds, pensions, union dues, etc.

----

### Non-Traffic Citations (Renhan's Data):

Link: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/non-traffic-citations

This dataset contains information about non-traffic citations, which are low-level criminal offenses where a law enforcement officer<br>
issues a citation instead of an arrest. As its names suggests, any citation regarding traffic is excluded from this data set.

We decided as a group that less citations means that it is easier to commit crimes in such neighborhood, since it means that actions<br>
that may be construed as a crime could be caught less often.

----

## Overview:

This repository is designed to determine the best Pittsburgh neighborhood to commit crime, using Police Crime, Neighborhood Wealth, and Non-Traffic Citations Data.
